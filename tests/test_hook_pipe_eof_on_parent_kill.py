"""Mechanism test: the 20s HookDeadline closes the hook stdout pipe.

The Windows hang: a fossilized SessionEnd hook runs the raw shape
``python measure.py collect --quiet && python measure.py dashboard --quiet``
directly from settings.json. When the host TerminateProcess-es the hook
runner, the measure.py grandchild can keep the inherited stdout pipe open
forever, wedging the turn at 3/4. The fix arms a 20s ``HookDeadline`` inside
``_dispatch_collect`` / ``_dispatch_dashboard`` on the hook path; the watchdog
daemon thread calls ``os._exit(0)`` when the budget elapses, which closes the
pipe regardless of what collect was doing.

This is the POSIX proxy for that Windows hang. The previous version of this
test was VACUOUS: it ran ``collect`` against an EMPTY tmp HOME, so collect
finished in ~0.1s on its own and the pipe EOF'd from normal completion, it
passed with every fix layer removed. This version drives a collect that
genuinely BLOCKS past the 20s budget, invokes the RAW fossil command shape
(``python measure.py collect --quiet`` — NOT run.py, which the fossil never
goes through), and asserts the pipe EOFs in a tight window around the 20s
budget, proving the ``HookDeadline`` ``os._exit(0)`` — not normal completion
— closed it.

How the block is made deterministic and machine-independent: a FIFO is seeded
as a session transcript under ``$CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR/projects/<proj>/*.jsonl``.
``_parse_session_jsonl`` opens it with a blocking ``open(path, "r")``; with no
writer ever connecting, the open() blocks FOREVER. So the only thing that can
close the stdout pipe is the 20s ``HookDeadline`` — there is no "normal
completion" path that could EOF it. This removes the machine-speed variance
that would come from seeding enough real transcript data to exceed 20s.

Discrimination (fix-present vs fix-absent) is provided by a companion control
that runs the SAME blocking collect with ``--rebuild``. ``--rebuild`` is the
one code path where the 20s budget is genuinely NOT armed
(``_install_hook_budget(20) if (_running_under_hook() and not rebuild) else
None``), so the control proves that without the budget the read would block
past the window (the FIFO never EOFs). Combined with the tight ~20s EOF in the
budget-armed run, the deadline is the only possible cause of the pipe closing.

Not skipped on Linux/macOS: this IS the POSIX proxy for the Windows
TerminateProcess hang (SIGKILL is not needed here; the deadline self-exits the
process, which is the exact mechanism that saves the inherited pipe). Only
skipped on native Windows, where mkfifo is unavailable.

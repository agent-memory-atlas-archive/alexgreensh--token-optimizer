"""LeaseLock.acquire must never give up on an observably FREE lease.

THE FLAKE THIS PINS
-------------------
tests/test_settings_never_clobbered.py::test_cleanup_period_and_statusline_writers_merge_stale_reads
failed ~1-in-5 on clean main. Instrumented interleaving (2026-09-02, both
threads entering _write_settings_atomic simultaneously):

    iter statusLine   1 try_create True          <- wins the lease, writes ~1ms
    iter cleanupPeriodDays 1 try_create False     <- lease held
    reclaim cleanupPeriodDays False                <- not expired, not released yet
    acquire cleanupPeriodDays False 0.0777 iters=2 <- gave up

The contender requested time.sleep(min(remaining, 0.004..0.012)) but the OS
delivered ~76ms (loaded box), so on loop iteration 2 the top-of-loop deadline
check ``monotonic >= stop`` fired BEFORE the retry attempt and acquire
returned False -- while the lease had been free for ~70ms. The bottom-of-loop
check already bounds the wait; the top check only ever skipped a final
attempt on a free lock.

THE FIX THIS PINS
-----------------
acquire() attempts first and checks the deadline after a failed attempt, so a
waiter that wakes late (overslept sleep, descheduled process) still takes a
free lease instead of reporting denial. The wait bound is unchanged: the loop
still exits at ``stop`` after a failed attempt, and never sleeps past it.

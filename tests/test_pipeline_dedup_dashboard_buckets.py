"""The PostToolUse pipeline path and cross-turn dedup must be headline-eligible
dashboard buckets, not silently excluded.

Regression guard: `bash_compress_hook.py` logs these features with
tier="measured", verified=True, intending them to count. The headline category
set derives from `_V5_COMPRESSION_LABELS` keys, so a missing label key silently
drops the whole path from the reported total (an UNDER-count). These tests fail
if either feature loses its label / headline eligibility, or if the hook stops
tagging the dedup case distinctly.

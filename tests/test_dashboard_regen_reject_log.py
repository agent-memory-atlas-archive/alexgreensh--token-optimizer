"""A rejected regenerate click must leave a trace.

Root cause: the M-4 token check in
the dashboard daemon's do_POST runs BEFORE the api/regenerate handler. A wrong/
empty X-TO-Token was rejected with 403 before the handler ever ran, so
_log_regen was never called and daemon-regen.log stayed empty for weeks while
the user reported a dead button. The click was indistinguishable from nothing.

The fix adds a rate-limited `_log_reject_regen(path)` call on the token-reject
branch so a rejected api/* POST always writes one trace line (capped to one per
~30s so a looping client cannot spam the log).

These tests extract the shipped function out of the generated daemon source
(the same pattern test_daemon_measure_py_resolution.py uses for the resolver)
and assert both the logging behaviour and the do_POST wiring. They fail at edit
time if the reject trace is removed or moved out of the token-mismatch branch.

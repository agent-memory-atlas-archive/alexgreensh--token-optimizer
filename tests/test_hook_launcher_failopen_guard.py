"""Regression: hook commands must fail open (exit 0), never 127, when the
launcher path is missing.

The bug: a hook command execs ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/hooks/python-launcher.sh
with no existence check. When a plugin refresh GCs the old version dir, the
baked/resolved path points at a deleted directory, so `exec bash <deleted>`
prints "No such file or directory" and exits 127 on every tool call (the
trailing `exit 0` never runs because exec already replaced the shell).

Fix: every launcher command guards with `[ -r "$L" ] || exit 0` before exec.

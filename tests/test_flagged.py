"""Regression tests for the flagged-item sweep.

Covers:
* The WindowsApps interpreter probe must not spawn the
  console-subsystem python.exe on the healthy path. A live GUI twin
  (pythonw.exe/pyw.exe) proves the Store install real via POSITIVE PROOF OF
  LIFE (it must WRITE a marker file; its bare exit code is never trusted).
  The console --version probe remains the fallback correctness authority.
* T6-M3 carry-forward: dashboard HTML writes in openclaw and opencode are
  atomic (sibling temp file + rename), never truncate-in-place, and the
  openclaw CLI reports a write failure cleanly instead of an uncaught throw.
* commands/health.md and commands/quick.md route the non-Claude-Code
  (Codex/OpenCode/standalone) invocation through python-launcher.sh instead
  of a bare `python3` console spawn.
* keepwarm-experiment's `claude --help` spawn routes a missing
  binary through fail() (clean ABORT) instead of a bare FileNotFoundError.

Each test fails on the pre-fix code (verified by temporary revert).

"""Regression tests for daemon threading + non-blocking health.

The generated dashboard daemon used `socketserver.TCPServer` (single-threaded),
so a synchronous `POST /api/regenerate` (10-17s build) blocked EVERY other
request. Liveness probes (`/api/health`, `/__to_ping`) use 0.5-1s timeouts, so
during a regen the daemon read as DEAD, which could trigger a revive ->
`kickstart -k` that restarted the daemon mid-regen and aborted the click.

The fix:
  1. Switch the server to `socketserver.ThreadingTCPServer`.
  2. Guard shared per-request globals (`_regen_inflight`, `_last_regen`,
     `_MEASURE_PY_CACHE`, `_REJECT_LOG_LAST_TS`) with `_STATE_LOCK`.
  3. `/api/health` and `/__to_ping` already answer from constants without doing
     work, so under the threading server they answer instantly even mid-regen.

These tests boot the REAL generated daemon script in a subprocess against a
fake `measure.py` whose `collect`/`dashboard` steps sleep, so a regen takes a
known ~3s without depending on real session data. They assert:
  - A GET /api/health sent WHILE a regen is running returns in well under the
    regen duration (the liveness probe is not blocked).
  - A second POST /api/regenerate sent while the first is running is refused
    with 409 (the _regen_inflight guard still prevents overlap).
  - The generated source ships ThreadingTCPServer + _STATE_LOCK (structural).

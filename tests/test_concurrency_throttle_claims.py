"""Concurrency claims about the session-end flush throttle and backfill counter.

Two QA findings claimed CRITICAL concurrency races in the session-end flush path:
  1. TOCTOU in _session_refresh_due (check-then-touch on a marker file).
  2. Non-atomic read-modify-write on the backfill attempt counter.

Both the throttle check and the backfill counter live inside
_run_session_end_flush_worker, which acquires an mkdir-based lock
(_acquire_session_end_flush_lock) BEFORE reaching either code path. mkdir is
atomic on POSIX, so only one worker can ever reach the throttle or the counter.
These tests prove that guard holds under concurrent access, and separately
confirm the backfill itself is idempotent so even a hypothetical counter race
would do duplicate work, not corrupt state.

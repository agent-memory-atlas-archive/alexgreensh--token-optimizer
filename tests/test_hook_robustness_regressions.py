"""Regression tests for hook I/O and runtime resource hardening.

Each test reproduces a bug that was demonstrated live on main before the
hardening landed:

  1. read_stdin_hook_input blocked past its own _STDIN_TIMEOUT on a partial
     payload with a held pipe (select guarantees one byte; the old
     read(max_bytes) blocked until max_bytes or EOF).
  2. A planted reader-less FIFO at module_runner's once-a-day ro-pyc marker
     path hung the hook indefinitely (open(marker, "w") on a FIFO blocks;
     the except cannot interrupt a blocked syscall).
  3. _write_dashboard_meta_atomic leaked tmp_fd when os.fchmod raised between
     mkstemp and fdopen (50 leaked fds in 50 forced-failure calls).
  4. _handler_deadline restored an already-expired outer timer via
     setitimer(0.0), which DISARMS it, silently dropping the outer budget for
     every later handler in the runner.

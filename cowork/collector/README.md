# Cowork telemetry collector

`to_collector.py` receives Claude Cowork's OpenTelemetry export (OTLP/HTTP) —
Cowork's only token/cost window, since cloud sessions have no local transcript —
and folds it into Token Optimizer's normal trends store so Cowork sessions show
up alongside Claude Code and Codex.

## Modes

| Mode | What it does |
|---|---|
| (serve, default) | HTTP endpoint: accepts the probe phone-home + OTLP/HTTP POSTs, appends to capture files. |
| `--summarize` | Print per-session `api_request` event counts from captured telemetry. |
| `--ingest` | Parse captured OTel into TO's `trends.db` (`platform=cowork`), reusing measure.py's own schema helpers — no second schema. Upserts, so re-running mid-session refreshes totals. |
| `--cost-view [--days N] [--json]` | Tokens + cost grouped by host (claude-code / codex / cowork). The cross-agent spend view. |

## Run

```bash
# 1. Serve on loopback behind a protected HTTPS ingress reachable by cloud VMs.
python3 cowork/collector/to_collector.py --host 127.0.0.1 --port 4318

# 2. Point Cowork's OTel export at it (Org settings -> Cowork; http/protobuf).
#    The collector domain must be on Cowork's domain allowlist.

# 3. After sessions land, fold into trends and read the cross-agent view:
python3 cowork/collector/to_collector.py --ingest
python3 cowork/collector/to_collector.py --cost-view --days 30
```

The collector does not authenticate senders. Restrict the HTTPS ingress to
expected senders and enforce request limits there; do not expose port 4318
directly. Capture files can contain probe payloads and telemetry. The data
directory must be private (mode 0700 on POSIX) and capture files must be
private (mode 0600 on POSIX). Existing broader permissions or symlinked
capture files are refused, so correct those paths before restarting or use a fresh private
`--data-dir`.

`--ingest` locates measure.py via `--measure-path`, `TOKEN_OPTIMIZER_MEASURE_PATH`,
a repo-relative path, or the installed-plugin glob; if none resolve it aborts
cleanly rather than writing a divergent store. stdlib-only, fail-open.
